###1. Scouting trip (2 weeks):  
The OpenCRVS team will conduct an upfront consultation in-country. We will meet your team, understand the local stakeholders, resources and capacity available, and advise on an implementation approach. We can also help you identify appropriate partners and/or conduct some of the below steps with you.

<br>


###2. Digitisation & Design research (3 months)
We encourage countries to take time to understand how OpenCRVS will fit into the wider digital ecosystem and what civil registration services of the future look like.

- Conduct key activities outlined in the CRVS Digitisation Guidebook www.crvs-dgb.org
- Conduct design research in rural, urban, peri-urban locations to better understand the users and how OpenCRVS can respond to their needs

<br>

###3. Product configuration and field testing (4 months)
It is critical that a local team of designers and developers are engaged in the OpenCRVS implementation process. Now it is time to build a great, local team to manage OpenCRVS configuration, deployment and field testing..  

<br>

###4. Pilot (approx 12 months)
A small-scale, short-term experiment that will help you understand how a large-scale implementation of OpenCRVS will work across the country. The pilot should include deployment in a variety of locations (urban, rural, office, health facility, community etc.) to test with different user groups and contexts for maximum learning. The first 8 months will be used to test and iterate the service and product through a rigorous continuous improvement process, and the last 4 months will be used to test and monitor the effectiveness of the “fine-tuned” service. At the end of the pilot, an evaluation should be conducted and a business case for scale-up made.

###5. Progressive scale-up
