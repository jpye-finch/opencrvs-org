title: "Civil Registration and Vital Statistics"

###Why it's important
Civil registration formally records the details of key life events such as birth, death, marriage and divorce. It creates the foundation of an individual’s legal identity, which is critical for accessing many public services and can provide protection from abuse and neglect.

When countries generate and use real-time vital statistics based on civil registration, they can plan and deliver relevant government services based on accurate population data.

###Digital enablement of CRVS
Digital technologies can enable transformative improvements in CRVS systems. They have the potential to increase registration coverage, automate and standardise processes, integrate data from multiple systems and securely store data at scale.

The full potential of a digital CRVS system can only be realised, however, if it responds appropriately to the context in which it is operating. In many countries there are challenges in terms of infrastructure, human capacity and geography, which mean that systems that work well in high-income countries may be less effective in lower-resource contexts.

While digitisation of CRVS systems has become a priority for governments around the world, no digital CRVS system has been available that properly responds to common problems that low- and middle-income countries experience. As a result, birth and death registration rates in many countries remain critically low.
